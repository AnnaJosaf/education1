# Machine learning models
## Supervised Learining: 
- Definition : In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset,
  where the input data is paired with corresponding output labels.
- Example Applications: Image classification, speech recognition , regression.
## Unsupervised Learning: 
- Definition: Unsupervised learing involves training models on unlabeled data.
  The system learn to identify patterns and relationships within the data without
  explicit guidance.
## Semi-supervised Learning:
- This learning paradigm combines elements of supervised and unsupervised learning.
