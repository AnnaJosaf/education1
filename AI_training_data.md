# AI Training Data 
## Diversity :
- Training data should be diverse and representative of the real-world scenarios the
  AI model is expected to handle. Diversity helps the model generalize well to new, unseen
  data.
## Volume :
- Larger datasets often contribute the better model performance, up to a certain point.
  More data allows the model to learn a wider range of patterns and nuances.
## Labeling :
- Many AI models, especially in supervised learning, require labeled data, where each input
  is associated with crossponding output or target label.
